        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="summary">
            <a rel="external" class="url" href="https://connector.im/">Connector</a> solves the problem of how to share your contact information and keep it updated.
        </p>    

        <p class="summary">
            Connector is very consumer focused, but companies also have problems sharing and managing employees information. In most companies there is a lot of duplication of employee information creating inefficency and innacuracy. Is there an easy way for you to view and correct the address your employer has on your record? Would HR automatically update the accounts department? 
        </p>

        <p class="summary">
            For Connector to work for business it would need to facilitate the sharing of contacts. In order to illustrate how this might work I've sketched out how an employee directory might work.

           <ul>
                <li> Do visitors to the page use the selector?</li>
                <li> Does the new interface reduce the percentage of consumers who click through to the next screen by a statistically significant amount?
                </li>
                <li> If this is the case is the information that is gained worth more than the potential loss of customers?
                </li>

        <h2>A Solution?</h2>        

        <p class="summary">
            One solution might be to offer users who for whom the two boxes currently available don't meet their needs the opportunity to indicate what they are looking for.
        </p>

        <p class="summary">
            The users selection could be captured and they could be presented with the option to leave their details or if appropriate Marley Spoon could persuade them to buy one of the existing boxes.

            This information could be used to make important decisions about how the Marley Spoon offering evolves and to identify prospective clients for new products.

            If the pricing page was changed, A/B testing could be used to see how vistors react differently to the changed page and answer the following questions:

            <ul>
                <li> Do visitors to the page use the selector?</li>
                <li> Does the new interface reduce the percentage of consumers who click through to the next screen by a statistically significant amount?
                </li>
                <li> If this is the case is the information that is gained worth more than the potential loss of customers?
                </li> 
            </ul>
